Procedure to build the Theory plug-in with Maven:

1. Download the Rodin target platform bundle (org.rodinp.dev-VERSION.zip) from
Sourceforge and unzip it in a new folder, for example /tmp/rodin.

2. Run the following command from the directory containing this README:

mvn -DrodinTargetSiteUrl=file:///tmp/rodin package

3. Upload the files in org.eventb.theory.repository/target/repository to the
server of the update site or add the folder as a local update site in your
Eclipse configuration.
