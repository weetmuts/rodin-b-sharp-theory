Procedure to build the Theory plug-in with Maven:

1. Download the Rodin target platform bundle (org.rodinp.dev-VERSION.zip) from
Sourceforge and put it in /var/tmp (if it is not possible, update the path to
it in org.eventb.theory.feature/org.eventb.theory.feature.target)

2. Run the following command from the directory containing this README:

mvn package

You can also add the hash of the latest git commit to the version with:

mvn package -Dversion-suffix=-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)

3. Upload the files in org.eventb.theory.repository/target/repository to the
server of the update site or add the folder as a local update site in your
Eclipse configuration.
