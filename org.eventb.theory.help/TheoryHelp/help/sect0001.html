<div><h1 id="a0000000002">1 Motivation</h1>
<p> Up to Rodin v2.0, the mathematical language used in Event-B has been fixed. As such, it was not possible to define reusable polymorphic operators. A workaround was to define any required operators as set constructs in contexts. Originally, contexts were supposed to provide a parametrization of machines. The aforementioned limitations of the Event-B language lead to users to use contexts for purposes for which they were not intentionally devised. Examples of operators that can be useful to users include the sequence operator (which was present in classical B mathematical language) and the bag operator. </p><p>In Rodin v2.0, support for customised syntactic symbols was introduced. The Theory plug-in, as a result, evolved from being just a component to define rewrite rules to a versatile platform to define and validate proof and language extensions. </p></div>
